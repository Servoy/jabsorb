jabsorb -- A JSON-RPC ORB in Java and JavaScript

This jabsorb is using a newer version (with bugfixes) of org.json classes.
Still we needed to keep backwards compatibility with previously written JSON, so for example some things that became stricter need to be loosened up a bit so org.json has some changes (like allowing strings split on multiple lines with \).

I has a maven pom.xml for just building a jar + testing, ...

It also has a possibility to generate an eclipse plugin out of it using p2-maven-plugin. See pom <description> for more info.

A migration to tycho would be ideal in the future.
