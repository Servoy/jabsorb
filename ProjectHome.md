**jabsorb** is a simple, lightweight JSON-RPC library for communicating between Javascript running in the browser and Java running on the server. It allows you to call Java methods on the server from Javascript as if they were local, complete with automatic parameter and result serialization.

Thanks to Georg Kallidis for publishing jabsorb 1.3.2 on maven:
