CHANGES log

2007-09-20 jabsorb 1.1 release

new features:

* SLF4J logging - makes it easy to integrate into other java frameworks or 
  web applications that may use a different server side logging system.

* GZIP compression to transparently compress the JsonRpcServlet response-- 
  we are seeing compression results that are easily 1/10th the size for 
  typical json responses.  This is useful for small applications that may 
  not be already utilizing a filter or some other means of compressing 
  dynamic responses.  It can easily be turned off if it's not needed for 
  some reason.
    
* The JavaScript client code, jsonrpc.js is also now distributed in an extra 
  alternative, "minified" version that was created with the YUI Compressor.  
  Gzipped versions of jsonrpc.js are also included for web servers that can 
  take advantage of this.
  
* More extensive javadoc and more manual sections (Custom Serializers are now 
  documented.)
  
* Upgraded to json.org library version 2.0 which has bug fixes and many 
  additional general purpose JSON utilities.
  
* Pretty printing of the send and receive JSON in the server log when debug 
  is on (this makes debugging much easier.)
  
* Optimized JSON escaping, and added method caching for callable references 
  to improve performance.

2007-08-31
* jabsorb library created as a fork based on the json-rpc-java trunk
  reformatted code to new style guidelines
  repackaged into org.jabsorb package space
  merged org.json classes (which were already a fork off the orginals anyway)
  into org.jabsorb.json package space.
  -- Arthur Blake and William Becker

json-rpc-java/svn/trunk

* Switch from java.util logging to SLF4J.
  (the simple logging facade for java--see http://slf4j.org)
  so that json-rpc-java can be easily integrated with projects
  that use other java logging systems.  The test webapp still
  uses java.util logging (although it's now via SLF4J.)
  The json-rpc-java library now has a dependency on slf4j.
* Added conveniance target 'uninstall' that removes .war and
  the expanded .war folder from tomcat.
  -- Arthur Blake <arthur_blake@users.sourceforge.net>

* Add asynchrounous support to the constructor JSONRpcClient
  constructor. Previously the constructor would make a
  synchronous call to system.listmethods. Now if the
  constructor is called with a function as the first
  argument, it will construct the proxy asynchrously,
  calling the function when this is done.
  -- Michael Clark <michael@metaparadigm.com>

* Add ExceptionTransformer interface and interface to
  JSONRPCBridge to transform exception objects returned
  to the client.
  -- Rhys Yarranton, rhys dot yarranton at albertasolutions dot com

* Make Hello test page use async callback.
* Modify unit test page to allow running a single test by
  clicking on a link.
* Add HttpServletResponseLocalArgResolver and pass
  HttpServletResponse object into calls so that exported
  methods can get access to it.
* Add RawJSONObjectSerializer and RawJSONArraySerializer to allow
  methods to return hand constructed JSON object representations
* Formatting cleanups in example Dictionary client
  -- Michael Clark <michael@metaparadigm.com>

json-rpc-java-cvs

* Add a new overloaded registerObject call that allows the
  caller to specify the class/interface to be used for exporting
  methods on the object (exported methods are restricted to
  just the interface class).
  -- Ian Sollars, ian at sollars dot gmail dot com
* Add back ObjectInstance wrapper class to allow us to store
  the interface to be used to export for the associated object.
  -- Michael Clark <michael@metaparadigm.com>

* License changed from LGPL to Apache License, Version 2.0 after
  approval from all authors/contributors
* Update JSP pages to use common header and footer and new style
* Remove eval function from test.jsp
* Simplify async callback in unit test
  -- Michael Clark <michael@metaparadigm.com>

* Allow derived versions of JSONRPCServlet to override a
  findBridge method to provide a custom method of locating
  the JSONRPCBridge object.
  -- Todd Lindner, tlindner at dynax dot com

* Add java.math.BigDecimal marshalling/unmarshalling support
  to NumberSerializer.
  -- Michael Clark <michael@metaparadigm.com>

* Fix JavaScript client failure the HTTP authentication in Firefox
  -- Mark F Murphy, markm at tyrell dot com

* Remove auto-creation of session specific bridge and associated
  options from JSONRPCServlet (ie. default is to invoke against
  objects in the global bridge). Updated manual, tutorial,
  JSONRPCServlet and JSONRPCBridge docs to reflect this.
* Made JSONSerializer instance global to reduce memory used by
  session specific bridges. The global JSONSerializer instance
  can be changed or added to, to allow for custom Serializers.
* Remove keepalive disable option from JSONRPCServlet as the
  Connection: keepalive header was causing problems and is not
  required for keepalives in all modern browsers.
* Remove enableReferences from API, references are enabled when
  this first call to registerReference or registerCallableReference.
  This keeps the bridge state smaller if references are not enabled.
* Move most bridge state data into a new class JSONRPCBridgeState
* Remove ObjectInstance inner class from JSONRPCBridge and change
  code to use Object directly in the objectMap
* Remove reference registrations from unit.jsp as they are not used
* Add more Java docs to various classes and methods.
* Move reflection related code out of JSONRPCBridge and into
    com.metaparadigm.jsonrpc.reflect.ClassAnalyzer.
* Move inner classes ClassData and MethodKey from JSONRPCBridge into
    com.metaparadigm.jsonrpc.reflect package.
* Move inner class CallbackData from JSONRPCBridge into
    com.metaparadigm.jsonrpc.callback.CallbackData.
* Move callback implementation details from JSONRPCBridge into:
    com.metaparadigm.jsonrpc.callback.CallbackController.
* Move inner class CallbackData from JSONRPCBridge into
    com.metaparadigm.jsonrpc.callback.CallbackData.
* Move local argument processing out of JSONRPCBridge into
    com.metaparadigm.jsonrpc.localarg.LocalArgController.
* Move localarg implementations (HttpSession, etc) into:
    com.metaparadigm.jsonrpc.localarg.impl.
* Add a simple perl script utility for making a smaller JS file.
* Add unregisterClass, unregisterObject, lookupClass and lookupObject
  methods to JSONRPCBridge to enable external lifecycle management of
  exported classes and objects
* Package reorginisation. New packages:
    com.metaparadigm.jsonrpc.serializer
    com.metaparadigm.jsonrpc.serializer.impl
    com.metaparadigm.jsonrpc.localarg
* Source code formatting changes for Eclipse. No longer have the
  tab issue with emacs when used in an editor with tabstop=4. The
  source code was previously formatted with tabstop=8 with 4 char
  indents and space stuffing that caused problems with Eclipse users.
  -- Michael Clark <michael@metaparadigm.com>

json-rpc-java-1.0rc2

  Summary of changes

    * Improved documentation. More Javadoc comments and addition on
      documentation on References and LocalArgResolvers to the manual.
    * JSON-RPC JavaScript Client bugfixes, changes to comments and
      addition of trailing ; to function assignments to allow usage
      or certain script compressors.
    * Fix to keepalive handling.
    * Implement Serializable on all JSONRPCBridge related objects to 
      enable sessions to be persistent against tomcat restarts and
      clustering should now work.
    * Add ErrorInvocationCallback interface to allow callbacks to
      get notification of server side errors.

Changes since 1.0rc1

* Created branch in CVS. To check out 1.0 branch use:
   cvs update -r R1_0_BRANCH
* Add documentation on References, Callable References and LocalArgResolver
  to the manual
* More Javadoc updates
* Change // comments to /* */ comments in jsonrpc client
* Add ; to end of function variable assignments in jsonrpc client
* Return http object to pool if we get a connection error
* Fix put in poolReturnHTTPRequest where we pushed a deleted http
  object onto the spare array
* Implement Serializable on more classes to make Session persistence
  and clustering possible
* Don't add 'Connection: keep-alive' header in JSONRPCServlet as this is
  not actually required for keepalive connections with HTTP/1.1 clients
  (ie. any browser that implements XMLHttpRequestObject).
  This header was perhaps a cause for the subtle and infrequent breakage
  seen with certain connector, webserver and browser combinations causing
  empty bodies to be sent to the server. Content-length is all that is
  required for keepalive connections to work with HTTP/1.1 clients - this
  header can still be disabled with the keepalive=0 servlet param although
  many containers will still maintain keepalive connections by reverting to
  chunked encoding.
  -- Michael Clark <michael@metaparadigm.com>

* Add more Javadoc comments to InvocationCallback interface
* Add ErrorInvocationCallback interface to allow callback functions
  to be notified of exceptions generated while invoking methods
  on exported objects
  -- Brett Connor, connorb at axxia dot com
  -- Michael Clark <michael@metaparadigm.com>

* Make JSON-RPC JavaScript client throw Exception consistent with
  other client exceptions if there is a connection error
  -- Krzysztof Ogrodnik, OgrodnikK at axxia dot com
  -- Michael Clark <michael@metaparadigm.com>

* Add additional Javadoc comments to LocalArgResolver interfaces and
  associated classes
* Fix bug in JSONRPC JavaScript client where we forget to set
  async timeout handler variable causing the async handler function
  to get called back multiple times with no work to be done
* Implement Serializable on JSONRPCBridge and mark a few fields as
  transient that aren't required during serialization
  -- Michael Clark <michael@metaparadigm.com>

json-rpc-java-1.0rc1

  Summary of changes

    * Ability to handle generic Object and Interface method signatures.
    * Closer conformance with the JSON-RPC specification.
    * Ability to cancel async requests.
    * Now sends Dates in milliseconds.

  Upgrade notes

    * Code that unmarshalls Dates will need to be changed from:
      new Date(object.time*1000) to: new Date(object.time)
    * Backwards compatibility code with 0.7 release has been removed.
    * CallableReference has been changed on the wire so if these are
      used then then both the client and server must be 1.0rc1.

Changes since 0.9

* Avoid memory leak on IE in jsonrpc JS client by removing callback
  function once we have recieved the callback
  -- Evan Leonard, evan at mindreef dot com

* Allowed BooleanSerializer to accept JSONObjects of type string, if they
  can be converted to a Boolean.
  -- Ryan Gates ryan.gates at gmail dot com

* Fetching servlet config at init time instead of on each request
* Add servlet config option 'keepalive' when set to 0 disables keepalives
  -- Michael Clark <michael@metaparadigm.com>

* Fix JSONRPCResult to use Throwable instead of Exception so all kinds
  of Throwable types can be handled
  -- Igor Bernstein, happycrappy at gmail dot com

* Handle case where a method generic signature such as Object is overloaded
  with a more specific signature. Previously the method matching code
  would pick an arbitrary method. Now the method with the specific
  matching class signature will be chosen.
* Fix date value truncation introduced when converting Date marshalling
  format into milliseconds.
  -- Nicola Piccinini, pic at mayatecnologie dot com

* Fix serializer selection logic when passing a hinted JS object into a
  Java method with either an interface or Object signature. Previously
  objects unmarshalled by the BeanSerializer had to be passed into a
  method with the concrete class signature. Now Beans with strong type
  information (type hints i.e. "javaClass" property) can be passed into
  methods with Interfaces and Object signatures.
* Send Dates in milliseconds - not seconds as before (this didn't
  really make any sense as both Java and JavaScript natively store Dates
  internally in milliseconds). Code that unmarshalls Dates currently just
  sees a plain JavaScript object and access the 'time' field, this code
  will need to be changed from: new Date(object.time*1000) to the much
  simpler form: new Date(object.time)
* Change jsonrpc.js to set unique id field in request as per JSON-RPC spec
* Change JSONRPCBridge to decode id if present and return it in replies.
  Currently niether the client nor server require the id to be present.
  This required changes to the protected JSONRPCBridge.call interface to
  pass in the entire undecoded JSON-RPC request object. This had the effect
  of simplifying the JSONRPCServlet code which is a good thing.
* No longer add objectID attribute to requests made on CallableReferences.
  This was a break from JSON-RPC protocol. Now we encode the objectID into
  the method in the form ".obj#<objectID>.methodName" so our requests are
  now completely compatible with JSON-RPC spec.
* Remove backwards compatibility with 0.7 client/server. This served its
  purpose as easing upgrades between 0.7 and 0.8 releases but now was just
  adding to the complexity of the code.
* Made JSONRPCBridge.call public instead of protected.
* Made JSONRPCResult public and added accessor functions for its properties.
* Changed JSONRpcClient JS client instance method names use _ prefix
  to avoid the possibility of clashing with dynamic proxy methods created
  from associated Java server side objects (these methods were never exposed
  as part of a public API but there was the possibility that they may clash).
* Added JSONRpcClient.cancelRequest(id) static method to the JS client that
  will cancel an inflight async call (returns true if it found the request
  and is able to cancel it). The id is the JSON-RPC request id and is the
  value returned from the async call when it is submitted.
  -- Michael Clark <michael@metaparadigm.com>

json-rpc-java-0.9 (About time for a release release)

* Make jsonrpc.js serialize JavaScript Date object as a Java Date by
  setting the appropriate class hint
  -- Nicola Piccinini, pic at mayatecnologie dot com

* All serializer classes given public access
* Modified DateSerializer to accept and convert java.sql.Timestamp and
  java.sql.Date.
* Introduced attribute 'marshallClassHints' in the JSONSerializer class.
  If set to false, the 'javaClass' JSON hints are not included by 
  serializers.  Defaults to true.  Modified all serializers to use this 
  setting in JSONSerializer.
* Introduced attribute 'marshallNullAttributes' in the JSONSerializer class.
  If set to false, then any bean field that is null in Java will not serialize
  the attribute name to the client.  Defaults to true.
* Exposed getter and setter attributes for the JSONSerializer object in the 
  JSONRPCBridge.
* Added constructor to JSONRPCBridge indicating to not register the default
  serializers in the JSONSerializer.
* Allowed NumberSerializer and PrimitiveSerializer to accept JSONObjects of 
  type String, if they can be converted to the appropriate primitive or number.
* Allowed StringSerializers to accept JSONObjects of type integer.
  -- Ryan Gates <ryan dot gates at gmail dot com>

* Make registerCallback/unregisterCallback non static (again)
* Change in JSONRPCBridge.analyzeClass to fix bug with exporting of inherited
  methods exposed methods of Object which is not a good idea so we exlucde
  these now.
* Add InvocationCallback test case to Test.java and test.js
* Add LocalArgResolver test case to Test.java and test.js. The simple test
  allows set the debug flag on the JSONRPCBridge instance
* Complete LocalArgResolver implementation
* Make methods to register and unregister InvocationCallback and
  LocalArgResolver static ie. no longer bridge instance specific.
* Added methods to unregister InvocationCallback and LocalArgResolver
* Change contextClazz arg of registerLocalArgResolver to contextInterface
* Fix hash and equals function of CallbackData to allow registering of the
  same InvocationCallback with multiple contextInterfaces (previously the
  equals function would have replaced the previous entry if it was registered
  again with a different contextInterface).
* Change name of contextClazz argument of registerCallback to contextInterface
  and implement the functionality (previously this argument was ignored).
  This is a step towards allowing implementation of other transports where
  the context object passed to callbacks may not be HttpServletRequest.
* JSONRPCBridge.call now takes an array of context objects
* use clazz.getMethods() instead of clazz.getDeclaredMethods() in
  JSONRPCBridge.analyzeClass to fix bug with exporting of inherited methods
* Add debug="true" to javac attributes in build.xml
* Try to work out class for arrays in JSONSerializer.getClassFromHint
* Fix marshalling and unmarshalling of null bean values
* Added configuration for JBoss 3.2.x and JBoxx 4.0.0 to build.xml
* Make [Un]MarshallException constructors public
* Don't prepend exception.message with the exception type as this can be
  got with exception.name
* ReferenceSerializer uses System.identityHashCode(o) instead of o.hashCode()
  to avoid possible clashes.
* Change debug messages to use java.util.logger.Logging.
* Now 'ant docs' builds javadocs for org.json package.
* Documentation fix to Manual for Set type mapping.
* Convert BeanSerializer state over to new SerializerState interface and
  change it to throw exception when encountering circular references to
  match documentated behaviour.
* New SerialiazerState object added and passed as a stack variable to
  allow Serializers to keep state for the current serialization as Serializer
  instance variables can't be used for this due to concurrency issues.
* Split serializer code out of JSONRPBBridge and into new JSONSerializer class
* Make Serializer interface public. Subject to change until 0.9 is released.
* Don't register ReferenceSerializer by default. Application now needs to
  call JSONRPCBridge.enablesReferences(). This is subject to change before
  release of 0.9 (perhaps automatically registered in session bridges)
* Instantiate serializers in global bridge to allow stateless use when
  no per session bridge is used.
* Fix information leak of protected method names. duh!
* Rename JSONRPCCallback to InvocationCallback (trivial code changes
  required for users of the callback interface).
* Add Class contextClazz argument to registerCallback so only the specific
  type of context object is passed to the callback (allows for easier
  implementation of transport specific callbacks). Need to implement
  (argument is currently ignored as we so far only have one type of context
  object passed through 'HttpServletRequest')
* Add LocalArgResolver interface and associated registerLocalArgResolver
  method to JSONRPCBridge and Java Docs (currently unimplemented)
  -- Michael Clark <michael@metaparadigm.com>

* Fix logic bug in JSONSerializer when marshalling null with debug enabled
  -- Spotted by Nicola Piccinini, pic at mayatecnologie dot com

* Add servlet config option to disable auto creation of per session
  bridge. Completely stateless usage should now be possible.
  -- David Croft, davidc at sargasso dot net

* Fix typo in unit.js
  -- Hendra, hendra at ofs dot edu dot sg

* Fix JSONArray join so that "null" is used for null objects rather an
  empty string
* Use System.identityHashCode(o) instead of o.hashCode for circular
  reference check in BeanSerializer
  -- Suggested by Christopher Taylor, cstaylor at nanshu dot com

* Change type of servlet transport context object used for JSONRPCCallback
  from HttpSession to HttpServletRequest (to make stateless usage possible).
  This breaks backwards compatibility for implementors using the callback
  interface although required changes are trivial.
  -- Suggested by David Croft, davidc at sargasso dot net

* Fix typo in poolReturnHTTPRequest(http) delete http instead of delete htpp
  -- Evan Leonard, evan at mindreef dot com

json-rpc-java-0.8 (Valentine Rooster)

  Summary of changes

    * Unicode and other character set support
    * Asynchronous support
    * Unicode test suite
    * Regression test suite
    * Dictionary demo
    * Browser Compatiblity database
    * Hello World sample app
    * Tutorial and Manual updates
    * Protocol sync with the JSON-RPC spec

  Upgrade notes

    * A change to the JSON-RPC protocol was introduced in this release.
    * Please upgrade both JavaScript client (jsonrpc.js) and Java
      server code (jsonrpc.jar) in your applications.
    * Backwards compatibility code has been added to the server so it
      will still work with the 0.7 client (although upgrade is recommended).

Changes since 0.7

* Add exception documentation to the manual
* Add exception error code definitions to JSON-RPC JavaScript client
* Restore capability to access remote Java stack trace for remotely
  thrown exceptions (these were previously in the result from the server
  but not retained in the JavaScript side exception object).
  The remote exception type can be retrieved in e.name the message in
  e.message (both as per JavaScript Error objects). The Java stack
  trace in e.javaStack. See test.jsp Exception test example.
* Add instructions to Tutorial for building and installing from source.
* Big change in the way we handle unicode data.
  - The setCharset call has been removed from JSONRPCBridge as it is no
    longer required.
  - All unicode data between the client and server is now escaped using
    JSON unicode escape sequences so the communication is ASCII clean.
  - This is a little less efficient although this must be done due to bugs
    in Safari and Konqueror where they don't honour the encoding
    in the Content-Type header on recieved data from the server. Data is
    also escaped in the client to server direction to avoid potentical
    problems with browsers (that send data in the charset of the window, as
    the charset cannot be set on some XMLHttpRequest object implementations)
    and to be symetric.
  - These changes make the JSON-RPC-Java server and client charset clean.
  - The server will still accept non escaped unicode data correctly if the
    charset in the request is set or if not provided defaults to UTF-8
    (which appears to be what most XMLHttpRequest object implementations do).
    This means the server should remain compatible with other JSON-RPC
    clients such as jsolait.
* Add test cases for string and control character escaping
* Add back compat code to the JSONRPCServlet for handling <= 0.7 clients
* Change JSON marshalling in JavaScript client to use global toJSON
  function instead of extending various core object prototypes with
  toJSON methods. This resolves problems with code that does
  for(var x in obj) seeing the toJSON function and not expecting it.
* Change to String marshalling in JSONObject to unicode escape all
  non ASCII character (>= 0x80) - this fixes Safari and Konqueror
  whose XMLHttpRequest ignores character encodings so the UTF-8 stream
  isn't decoded to JavaScripts native UTF-16 (this is a workaround
  until a better solution is found)
* Added unicode test demo which sends and recieves unicode data
* Sync JSONObject and JSONArray with json.org changes
* Added Browser compatibility database that dynamically tests browsers
  hitting the page for JSON-RPC capability and records the results
* Added new Hello demo showing simplest usage of JSON-RPC-Java
* Added new Unit Test that supports profiling and both synchronous
  and asynchronous testing of various JSON-RPC types
* Add profiling support for async requests. A third argument is passed
  to callbacks if the global flag JSONRpcClient.profile_async == true.
  The profile object contains 4 fields each with a Date objects as the value:
  "submit" - when the request was submitted, "start" - when the HTTP request
  was started, "end" - when the HTTP request completed, "dispatch" - when
  the result was dispatched to the callback.
* Added ability to override toplevel exception handler for cases where
  there is an uncaught exception in callback functions.
  eq. JSONRpcClient.toplevel_ex_handler = function(e) { myAlert(e); }
* Fix bug in Date marshalling (missing return). Dates are presently
  marshalled as an Integer in milliseconds (valueOf).
* Added Test cases for Float, Double, Long and Integer
* Fix bug in JSONObject with marshalling of Float objects
* Fix unmarshalling of number object types (Byte, Short, Integer, Long, ...)
* Modify build.xml so it works with both newer and older versions of
  the Jasper2 compiler. Due to changes in semantics of the outputDir
  attribute, the precompiled JSP now are unpackaged.
* Improved error handling in JavaScript JSON-RPC client.
* Fixed information leak bug in JSONRPCBridge where private method names
  of exported objects were showing to clients (although not callable)
* Set encoding on JSPs using <%@ page contentType="text/html; charset=UTF-8"%>
  instead of <meta http-equiv ... > to workaround tomcat 5.5 forcing a
  default encoding of ISO-8859-1 overriding the meta tag
* Workaround another Opera 8 Beta problem with Content-type headers
* Add a simple scheduler for async requests and responses using setTimeout
  callbacks to make sure requests are not submitted from callback context
  and to allow control of number of concurrent requests
* Add a second argument to JavaScript async callbacks for passing exception
  information ie. callback(result, null) and callback(null, exception)
* Added Dictionary lookup demo - A simple server side Java DICT protocol
  (RFC2229) client that can make queries against a local dict server, and
  exposes its API to a JavaScript/DHTML dictionary lookup GUI.
* Add Content-Length and Connection: keep-alive headers in JSONRPCServlet
* Set charset on all pages to UTF-8
* Use UTF-8 by default for encoding and decoding (can't set charset in
  Content-type request header with Moz/Firefox) - more testing needed
* Servlet decodes using charset in Content-type header (if one exists)
  otherwise defaults to the charset set on the JSONRPCBridge
* Enhance code that fetchs XMLHttpRequestObject with more names for MS XMLHTTP
* Change test.jsp to use standard JSP syntax (not XML).
* Update khtml patch to version in kdelibs CVS.
* Allow specifying the charset to be used for encoding and decoding JSON
  data to and from the servlet. The charset must be supported by the Java
  implementation (the mandatory charsets a Java implementation must support
  are: "US-ASCII", "ISO-8859-1", "UTF-8", "UTF-16BE", "UTF-16LE" and"UTF-16".
* Add initial working draft of manual
* Add pooling of XMLHttpRequest obejcts to allow multiple outstanding
  async requests (each async request has its own XMLHttpRequest object)
* Add initial async support. Async is enabled by passing a callback
  function as the first argument to your call. ie.
    jsonrpc.echo(function (msg) { print(msg); }, "ping");
* Session timeouts result in a 'method not found' due to the object no
  longer existing in the session. Give a more informative error message
* Add support for HTTP authentication to JSON-RPC JavaScript client
* Add section to tutorial to show how to use in a servlet
  -- Michael Clark <michael@metaparadigm.com>

* Fix txEval value in test.jsp to reflect variable name change in test.js
  -- Tan Chee Yong, cytan at ofs dot edu dot sg

* Fix bug in test.jsp - evalStr should be populated in doEval
  -- Jay Graves, skabber at gmail dot com

* Update protocol to match changes in JSON-RPC specification.
  'methodName' -> 'method', 'arguments' -> 'params'
  -- George White, george at stonehippo dot com

* Use try catch to workaround Opera's missing setContentType method
  instead of useragent test.
  -- Paul E. Davis, pauledavis at gmail dot com

json-rpc-java-0.7

* Fix IE brown paper bag bug. Opera fix in 0.6 broke IE, now look at
  user agent to make Opera work (without effecting IE).
  -- Michael Clark <michael@metaparadigm.com>

json-rpc-java-0.6

* Add more detailed browser support section to documentation
* Workaround missing setRequestHeader method of the XMLHttpRequest
  object in Opera 8 Beta
* Add patch and documentation notes on how to resolve POST bug in 
  Konqueror (requires patching kdelibs)
* Replace jsolait with lightweight json-rpc JavaScript implementation
* Better web navigation for tutorial and demo
  -- Michael Clark <michael@metaparadigm.com>

json-rpc-java-0.5

* Fix unmarshalling of generic collection interfaces (List, Map, Set)
* Added more details to the tutorial
  -- Michael Clark <michael@metaparadigm.com>

* Add test cases for unmarshalling hinted classed into methods with
  interfaces in their signature
* Added circular association detection to BeanSerializer
* Added marshalling and unmarshalling implementation to SetSerializer
* Added test cases for bean and set to test.js
  -- Tan Chee Yong, cytan at ofs dot edu dot sg

json-rpc-java-0.4

*  Documentation updates
   * Add boolean to list of supported primitive types
   * Specify Safari supported version as 1.2
*  Added BooleanSerializer to add missing support for boolean types
*  Added boolean array support to ArraySerializer
*  Added test cases for booleans and boolean arrays to test.js
*  Fixed bug with calling void methods or methods that return null
*  Remove stack trace from Exception message objects returned and
   instead place in a   field 'trace' - this is not part of the
   JSON-RPC spec but it helps me
*  Add JSONRPCCallback interface and associated registerCallback method
   to JSONRPCBridge to allow registration of a callback that is called
   before and after method invocation.
*  Callback is called with the method arguments and result in preInvoke
   and postInvoke respectively.
*  In the case of  JSON-RPC over HTTP with the JSONRPCServlet, the
   HttpSession object is passed as the context object to the callback
   which allows you to poke around in the session to perform such things
   as JAAS authentication, ie. login on preInvoke and logout on postInvoke.
   -- Michael Clark <michael@metaparadigm.com>

json-rpc-java-0.3

*  Intial public release
*  Renamed attributes in private JSON-RPC-Java protocol additions
   * object_id => objectID
   * json_type => JSONRPCType
   * java_class => javaClass
*  Changes to make requests on CallableReferences transparent.
   * Added objectID field to the JSON-RPC protocol message for invocations
     on methods of a CallableReference
   * Removed temporary hack to encode objectID in the URL
*  Automatic JSONRPCBridge creation in servlet if a bridge doesn't already
   exist in the HttpSession. Documentation changes to reflect this
*  Global bridge is now just a container for global registration of
   Classes and objects.
*  Moved Serializers out of Global bridge which now has no serializers
   and into session speciifc bridge instance.
*  No longer special case for per-bridge ReferenceSerializer as all
   serializers are registered in a session specific bridge instance.
*  References are always created in the session specific bridge (which
   allows them to be garbage collected when the session expires)
*  Moved reference maps from ReferenceSerializer into bridge.
   -- Michael Clark <michael@metaparadigm.com>

json-rpc-java-0.2

*  First working version posted to json-rpc mailing list
   -- Michael Clark <michael@metaparadigm.com>
